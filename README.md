# I2C-Communication-between-ESP8266-and-Arduino-Nano
This repository showcases an I2C communication setup between an ESP8266 acting as a master and an Arduino Nano operating as a slave. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate seamless data transmission and reception between these devices. The ESP8266's role as a master device, coupled with the Arduino Nano's slave configuration, enables efficient and reliable communication, expanding possibilities for IoT and embedded systems applications. Dive into the code and documentation to explore the intricacies of this communication setup and its potential applications.
